 * Publishes the DOM node a nudge watches, as a render input.
 *
 * The watched card is NOT one durable node. A pending question is rendered by
 * the live streaming <li> while the turn runs and by the DURABLE message row
 * once the turn parks (streamItemQuestionKeys suppresses whichever copy is not
 * current), so React genuinely mounts a NEW element mid-turn. Node identity is
 * therefore the only honest dependency for the observer below, and it must
 * arrive through STATE: a `useRef` mutation does not re-render, so the effect
 * would never re-run and the observer would stay bound to the detached node.
 * With the turn parked awaiting an answer nothing else re-renders, so that
 * observer is the only signal that could ever clear the cue.
 *
 * Returns `[element, ref]`. Attach `ref` to the element that IS the target,
 * and only while it is the pending one; every render path for that card must
 * publish through this same channel so a surface handoff is just a node swap.

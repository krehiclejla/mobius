"""Shell-level contract for chats waiting on their owner.

Owner-input events carry state only: the kind of interaction that is waiting
and, for durable questions, the exact id used by the question lifecycle.
Secure field metadata and values stay on the chat-scoped secure-input channel.

A saved owner-input card is also the single source of its owner notification:
the platform sends it once when the card is committed, so agents never send
their own "needs your answer" push.

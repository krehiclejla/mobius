"""Bound old Codex resume state without touching chats or credentials.

Möbius keeps provider homes on ``/data`` so chats can resume across container
replacement. Codex does not currently age its rollout JSONL files there, so the
archive grows forever even though Möbius already treats a missing old provider
thread as a normal cold-resume case. This owner applies Möbius's 14-day provider
default to Codex rollout files, then bounds Codex's own SQLite stores and
scratch space under the same lock (codex_store_compaction).

Concurrency waits only for Codex. This filesystem owner takes the exclusive
side of the cross-process Codex lock, whose shared side every launcher,
including standalone Reflection, holds for its full process lifetime, and it
also skips while any process holds a file under CODEX_HOME open, which covers a
Codex started outside those launchers. Other agents are never paused. Startup
can therefore reclaim before SQLite opens while still skipping safely if an
external Codex process is already active.

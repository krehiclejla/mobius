"""Which chats are rebuilding their context right now, for every viewer.

Manual compaction and provider switches summarize the chat in a disposable
provider turn that can take minutes while holding the chat's transition lock.
Sends wait behind that lock, so without a shared signal a reloaded tab, another
pane, or another device sees an idle chat whose new message silently sits in
flight. This process-local registry is the authority for that window: the
request that does the work marks it, chat reads report it, and the system
stream announces each edge so mounted views update without polling.

It is deliberately in-memory: the work is bound to the request's process, so a
restart ends both the work and the state together.

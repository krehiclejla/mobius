"""Reliable, drain-gated in-process worker restart for the owner-facing paths.

Shared by ``/api/admin/restart`` (the Settings button),
``/api/platform/restart`` (the update button), and typed owner Restart cards,
so competing surfaces cannot create multiple nonces, drains, or supervisor
requests.

Every restart routes through one DRAIN-GATED path (design §2.2): live turns are
never simply killed. The worker first sets the ``draining`` gate (new sends
queue), interrupts each live turn so it finalizes its partials + a "paused for a
platform update" note WITHOUT touching the pending queue, then asks the frozen
entrypoint supervisor to acknowledge the exact restart intent and cycle pid 1.
A SIGKILL backstop still guarantees recovery if the handshake or shutdown
wedges. Boot reconcile handles fallback markers and unacknowledged parks
manually.

    1. Set the ``draining`` gate so sends arriving during the restart queue
       rather than start, and both liveness sweeps stand down.

       turn (interrupt → finalize partials + a "paused for a platform update"
       note → mark clean stops due now; preserve the pending queue). Bounded by
       ``DRAIN_TIMEOUT``; a slow stop or failed terminal save retains its exact
       nonce-stamped running row, which authenticated startup converts to the

       acknowledgement, so the next boot recovers manually.

  Data is safe: the chat writer commits before any response returns, and the
  drain flushes each paused note before SIGTERM, so a hard kill loses nothing a
  graceful drain would have saved.

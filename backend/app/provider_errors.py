"""One set of rules for what kind of failure a provider reported.

Live turns (``chat``) and compaction turns (``compaction``) both need to know
whether a provider refused because the request was too large, the account is
out of credits, a usage or rate limit was hit, or sign-in failed. Each caller
owns its own wording and recovery; this module only owns the classification,
so the callers cannot disagree about what an error means.

Structured fields win over text: an HTTP status or a provider's own error type
is the provider's statement, while text matching is the fallback for errors
that arrive only as a message. Exhausted workspace credits win over the
status, because Codex reports them as a reached rate limit (429) although no
reset time will refill them.

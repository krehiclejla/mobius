"""Save an owner-input card and return its receipt, never wait for an answer.

The saved card ends the turn: the response is cut at the card, so say
everything before calling it. See app/questions.py for the card lifecycle.

Agents call this through the Möbius control tools. When a provider cannot
surface those tools, the one command-line fallback for every control is
`python3 /data/platform/backend/scripts/mobius_control_mcp.py call <tool>
--args-json '<json>'` (or `--args-json -` to read the JSON from stdin).
